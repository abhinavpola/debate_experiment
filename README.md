# LLM Debate experiment

Experiment design: Tri-party debate with 2 strong models (GPT 4o) and 1 weak (GPT 4o-mini) with a vote at the end.

- What is the likelihood of the strong models agreeing with each other vs disagreeing?
- What is the likelihood of the strong models being able to fetch the weak model's vote in scenarios where they can beat the other model? (i.e exclude scenarios where all 3 agree)

Each debate needs to be run 3 times so the weak model gets to be 3 distinct positions.
Debate lengths - 5 turns, 10 turns, 20 turns
